# World of Warcraft Character Sheet Template 
### Version 2.0 ###

## Overview
Version 2.0 of the World of Warcraft Character Sheet Template converts the old 1.0 page template version into a fully functional plugin. It uses much of the same code and API calls as the original version but it uses built-in WordPress functionality to add in the API key and client secret instead of relying on a third party plugin. Otherwise the functionality is the same as version 1.0, once activated it displays basic stats and information about the selected World of Warcraft character.

 ## Installation and Configuration
To install the plugin just download the files and add them to your plugins folder (wp-content/plugins by default). Then activate the plugin in your WordPress admin panel. You'll need to have an API key and client secret from [Blizzard] (https://develop.battle.net/https://develop.battle.net/). If you don't already have one you'll need to log into the site using the same Battle.net credentials you use to log into your World of Warcraft account. There is (as of this writing) no cost to signing up for an API key and client secret, but you'll need both to connect the plugin to the API to gather the plugin data.

Once you have the key and secret sorted out you'll just need to enter the name of the character you want to display along with the realm that character resides on.
